The ratio of newly synthesized and of total lung Type I to Type III lollagen was also determined. These experiments were performped in parallel on rats free of chrnoic respiratory disaese and a strain of conventional animal. The authors conclude that 1) the excess collagen deposited in granulomas and/or silicotic nodules as part of the fibrotic response of the lung is similar to normal luno collagen with respect to relative ratios of Tyes I and III present, in contrasY to the response of the lun to oxidant pneumotoxins; 2) the response of the lung to silica continues for at least 1 year; 3) there are essentially no differences in the responSe of chronic respiratory disease-free Sprauge-Dawley and conventional WistaHr rat", "label": "n"}
